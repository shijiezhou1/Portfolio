<h3 style="text-align: center;">Creative Switch&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>This project we start to learn about how to make a fun switch for the LED lights. When the switch is on off status, the light would show up like a loop. The detail is in the videoâ€™s link. As soon as I press the button, the lights will start from dimmer to brighter on pinMode 3, 9, 5, 6. The switch is a pencil stick that connects between position and negative. Alternatively, we can use pencil the draw the circle broad that we want since pencil is made out of graphite. The graphite rod is conductive, so we can draw a switch by using the pencil. The code is attached as well.</p>
